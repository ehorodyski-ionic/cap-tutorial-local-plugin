A step by step walkthrough that shows full life cycle, creating the plugin in the existing project and then extracting into a true reusable plugin.

- start with an API for something that is supported on Android and iOS, something simple, include links to the docs for the API(s)
- create a blank starter Capacitor app w/ platforms
- design the abstraction we want, explain options (domain based abstraction vs. thin binding, etc)
- create plugin in each platform
- modify blank starter to test out the plugin in some way (though some basic calls to it)
- break out code into a reusable plugin
