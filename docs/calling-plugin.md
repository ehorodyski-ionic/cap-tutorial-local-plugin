# Using the Plugin

## Adding the User Interface

Before we move onto writing implementations for the web, iOS, and Android platforms let's add some kind of user interface we can use to test out our plugin's functionality.

Since the focus of this walkthrough is building a Capacitor plugin and I arbitrarily chose the React flavor of the Ionic Framework to work with, I'll supply links to the finished `Home.tsx` and `Home.css` files below:

- [Home.tsx](src/pages/Home.tsx)
- [Home.css](src/pages/Home.css)

Take a look
